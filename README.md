# This is all new and scary

Look, I was just drinking tea someplace when a beam of light shone on me 
and whisked me away to a weird room with nothing along the stark white walls.

All I have is this keyboard that when I type stuff into it as I am doing now,
words pop up all over the room. So if you see this, help!
